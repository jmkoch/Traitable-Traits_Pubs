	abstract = {Self-incompatibility occurs widely in the Solanaceae, but a few species in this family, or a few intraspecific populations or a few individuals within the populations are highly self-compatible and their breeding systems have evolved from outcrossing to selfing. We studied pollination biology of Anisodus tanguticus from this family, a perennial endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. This species flowers in the early summer and probably suffers from the serious limitations of the outcrossing pollinator. We aimed to test whether the breeding systems of a few individuals in this species have shifted from outcrossing to selfing. Our experiments and observations were conducted in two populations with different altitudes. Most flowers of this species were incompletely protogynous, and the mean distance between the stigma and anthers decreased gradually with floral longevity. Both stigma and anthers did not come into touch when the corolla wilted in most of the monitored flowers and such herkogamy favours outcrossing. However, the complete contact of stigma and anthers in 4.9\% of the measured flowers suggested potential occurrence of {\textquotedblleft}autonomous selfing{\textquotedblright} in these flowers. Most of the examined individuals in both populations are self-incompatible and have to depend on insects for pollination. However, a few of them were found to be self-compatible. Flies were the effective outcrossing pollinators in the high altitude population and {\textquotedblleft}autonomous selfing{\textquotedblright} was detected in a few individuals of this population. In contrast, the effective outcrossing pollinators were rarely observed in the low altitude population and the dominant visitors or pollinators, ants in this population, transferred pollen within the single flower, which finally resulted in {\textquotedblleft}facilitated selfing{\textquotedblright}. Pollination limitations were obvious in both populations due to the lack of enough outcrossing pollinators. Two different selfing mechanisms, uncovered here, may provide a partial compensation for the natural reproduction of this alpine species in the arid alpine habitats when flowering at the early summer.},

An earlier morphological revision of the c. 50 species recognized three main groups, one consisting of the 23 Antillean species, another of southern South American and Andean species, and a third of species from the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield. Based on plastid and nuclear DNA sequences from up to 65 accessions representing 80\% of the species, we generated a phylogeny and a calibrated chronogram for Brunfelsia to infer clade expansion and shifts in pollinators and fruit types. Brunfelsia flowers offer nectar, and attract lepidoptera, hummingbirds, or bees; the fruits are dry or fleshy. Our results imply that Brunfelsia is 16-21Myr old and entered the Antilles from South America early during its history, with subsequent expansion along the island arc. The ancestor of the Antillean clade was hawk-moth-pollinated and had fleshy capsules, perhaps facilitating dispersal by birds. The only shift to hummingbird pollination occurred on Cuba, which also harbors the largest single radiation, with 11 species (10 included in our study) that apparently arose over the past 4Myr. Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico each sustained smaller radiations. The data also reveal at least one new species.},

and A. anisantha Endl., but differing most obviously in the smaller green and purple flowers.  It is the

only member of the genus confined to tall open-forest.  Although restricted, its distribution shows a

marked discontinuity, a common situation for conservative, relictual high-rainfall taxa in the area.

The species is of conservation interest owing to the small area of distribution and small number of

plants and populations known.  It is listed among conservation priority taxa for Western Australia.

A revised key to the spinescent species of Anthocercis is presented.},

From the preliminary analysis, it is found that gametophytic self-incompatibility is operating in this plant and it was overcome by bud-pollination.  In the present study, analyses were made to explore the incompatibility factors present in the pistil. For this, comparative protein profiling of pistils at various developmental stages was done and found that intensity of protein band at 74kDa gradually increases from the early developmental stages of the bud and reaches the maximum on the day of anthesis. In vitro assay and spectrophotometric analysis were carried out to find out the S-RNase activity in the pistil at various developmental stages and found that S-RNase activity in the pistils gradually increases with age.  From this study it can be concluded that S-RNase based gametophytic self-incompatibility system is operating in B. americana.},

	abstract = {Iochrominae is a florally diverse clade of 34 Andean species and six traditionally recognized genera within Physaleae. Recent phylogenetic estimates suggest that four of the six traditional genera of Iochrominae are not monophyletic. Using this phylogenetic framework, we examine the evolution of floral morphology and interspecific crossability in Iochrominae. Iochrominae is inferred to have had ancestrally a purple corolla, but now manifests a wide range of colors (red/orange, yellow, green, purple or white), several of which appear to have arisen multiple times. Other floral traits traditionally employed in taxonomy, including corolla shape, corolla length, and stapet form, are similarly evolutionarily labile and homoplasious within Iochrominae. To explore the extent of post-pollination reproductive isolation in the group and assess the potential for hybridization in nature, we conducted greenhouse crosses among seven species of Iochrominae representing five traditional genera. Of 21 reciprocal pairwise crosses, only two failed to yield viable seed. While the crossability index (a measure of successful seed set and germination) varied among crosses, it correlated only loosely with degree of relatedness. These results suggest that the speciation and diversification of Iochrominae has not been accompanied by the formation of strong barriers to pollen receipt or early seed maturation. However, pre-mating factors, such as allopatry and ethological isolation, and post-germination factors, such as reduced hybrid fitness, might have together acted to maintain the morphological and evolutionary cohesiveness of Iochrominae species. },
