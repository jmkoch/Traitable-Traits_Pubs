# Traitable-Traits_Pubs
This repo hosts **Traitable:** a django application to host taxonomic plant data published in scientific literature and the associated bibliographic data.

Within Traitable, there are two components: 
1) Traits:
 - hosts data on plant traits & taxonomy (genus, species, index of self-incompatibility, fruit type, etc.)

2) Publications:
 - hosts bibliographic data on publications associated with the data within 'Traits'
